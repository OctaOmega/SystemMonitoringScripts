# System Monitoring Sripts [OS Win]

Please be aware that the provided scripts are entirely written in Python and incorporate certain system tools such as Sysmon. However, it is important to note that these scripts are not intended for use in production environments. They have not undergone extensive streamlining or rigorous development processes, which could result in potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities.

These scripts are primarily designed for educational purposes and serve as a foundation for further exploration and learning in the field of computer security. They should not be relied upon as a comprehensive or sophisticated cybersecurity solution.

However, it is worth mentioning that I am currently working on combining these scripts into a security software application. This application aims to provide individuals and small business owners with an open-source tool to monitor computer systems and networks, without the need for complex cybersecurity tools or infrastructures.

I encourage and welcome any input, feedback, or contributions that can help improve these scripts and the forthcoming security software application. Your valuable insights can aid in enhancing the functionality, reliability, and security of the software, making it more useful and robust for a wider user base.

Please note that while efforts will be made to incorporate the suggestions and recommendations received, there is no guarantee that all input will be implemented. The development process will prioritize security, stability, and usability, while adhering to open-source principles.

Thank you for your understanding and your interest in improving these scripts and contributing to the development of the security software application. Together, we can create a more secure and accessible environment for individuals and small businesses.
